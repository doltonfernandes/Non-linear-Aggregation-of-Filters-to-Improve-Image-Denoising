## Problem Definition
A common problem encountered during image acquisition is of **noise** creeping in to images due to various reasons like poor lighting conditions, sensor issues, approximations during digitalization, image transmission etc. Therefore, *image denoising* is necessary to improve the quality of the image.

Many popular *denoising* techniques exist nowadays, but *image smoothening* during denoising is still a problem. Each denoising method has its pros and cons. We can use a combination of denoising techniques to denoise the image, and it needs to be adapted to different types of noise in the image.
