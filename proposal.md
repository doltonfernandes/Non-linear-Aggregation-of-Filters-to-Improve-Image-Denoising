## Problem Definition
A common problem encountered during image acquisition is of **noise** creeping in to images due to various reasons like poor lighting conditions, sensor issues, approximations during digitalization, image transmission etc. Therefore, *image denoising* is necessary to improve the quality of the image.

Many popular *denoising* techniques exist nowadays, but *image smoothening* during denoising is still a problem. Each denoising method has its pros and cons. We can use a combination of denoising techniques to denoise the image, and it needs to be adapted to different types of noise in the image.

## Project Goals  

## Expected Results
COBRA denoising method enhances the performance of the preliminary filters. We will use an aggregation of multiple filters, which allows us to take advantage of the abilities of all the individual filters which in turn, can adapt better to unknown noise levels. As our final result, we will demonstrate that such a non-linear aggregation of filters significantly outperform each of the individual filters. 

## Project Timeline
+ 19 Oct - 25 Oct:
    + Read and understand the given paper and all related papers
    + Set up the environment: Install all necessary libraries
+ 26 Oct - 30 Oct:
    + Use authorâ€™s set of images to run our code
    + Implement a basic denoising code
+ **Mid Evaluation: 31 October**
+ 01 Nov - 05 Nov: 
    + Further improve the denoising code
    + Implement a script to compare the similarity of 2 images
+ 06 Nov - 10 Nov:
    + Compare results of our code with other denoising methods
    + Compare results of our code with results from the paper
    + Do the above 2 steps for our own dataset of images
+ 11 Nov - 18 Nov: 
    + Perform a final set of tests and compare results. Make any improvements if needed
    + Prepare Presentation
    + Reserve time: To incorporate for delays
+ **Final Evaluation: 19-25 Nov**
